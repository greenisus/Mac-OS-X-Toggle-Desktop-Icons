This app is simple.  It simply toggles whether or not your Mac OS X Desktop shows any icons.  It's the equivalent of running this in Terminal:

defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool [false|true]
killall Finder

Caveats:
1. If you have Finder windows open, they will be closed.
2. It does not preserve the placement or order of your icons
3. I have no graphic design skills, so there's no pretty icon :)

Link to download and install:

https://github.com/greenisus/Mac-OS-X-Toggle-Desktop-Icons/raw/master/Toggle%20Desktop%20Icons.dmg

After that, drag the app to the Applications folder.  From there you can drag it to the Dock if you like.

Enjoy!
